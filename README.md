# [Project 1: Analyzing Air Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://github.com/cchang72/BA775_Project/blob/main/Analyzing-Air-Quality-During-COVID19-Pandemic.ipynb)
* Background: Air pollution, as one of the most serious environmental problems confronting our civilization, is the presence of toxic gases and particles in the air at levels that pose adverse effects on global climate and lead to public health risk and disease. Exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants has been implicated in a diverse set of medical conditions including cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, lung cancer and autism. Air pollutants come from natural sources such as wildfires and volcanoes, as well as are highly related to human activities from mobile sources (such as cars, buses and planes) or stationary sources (such as industrial factories, power plants and wood burning fireplaces). However, in the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented changes to the our work, study and daily activities, subsequently led to major reductions in air pollutant emissions. 
* Objective: To examine the air quality in the past two years and look on how the air quality was impacted in countries and cities where the corona-virus was prevalent.
* Tools: SQL/Tableau/Google Cloud (Big Query, Jupyter Notebook)

# [Project 2: HR Analytics: Job Change in Data Scientists](https://github.com/cchang72/BA780_Project/blob/main/BA780_Deliverable_Finalization.ipynb)
* Background: A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who received training. "Company" wants to analyze the factors affecting candiates' decision on staying or looking for a new job after training.
* Objective: The project goal is to predict whether a data scientist candidate will look for a new employment or wants to work for the company after training, which helps optimize HR costs and increase efficiencies. By using both descriptive and predictive analysis on a company’s HR dataset, we seek to interpret affecting factors on employee decisions.
* Tools: Python (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scikit-learn)/Google Colaboratory Notebook

# [Project 3: Fashion Brand Experiment](https://github.com/cchang72/BA830_Project/blob/main/BA830_Fashion%20Brands%20Experiment_Write%20up_Chris%20Chang%2C%20Yesol%20Lee%2C%20Yongxian%20Lun%2C%20Linh%20To.pdf)
* Background: In spite of the global recession and pandemics’ influence on global economies, luxury brands are everywhere. According to Bain & Company, the luxury goods market returned to pre-pandemic growth in 2021. The sales are estimated to top 283 billion euros, which is $325 billion. Moreover, younger consumers are increasing. As reported by Boston Consulting Group, Gen Z and Millennials are set to represent more than 60 percent of the luxury market by 2025. In this regard, our team wanted to research how brand name affects the preference of products, especially amongst young consumers. Thus we used a survey to measure how people’s preferences change among very similar designed clothing of high-end brands and inexpensive brands.
* Objective: The goal of the experiment was to observe the effect of exposing fashion brands on consumption decisions of young people who have graduated with the age range of 22 - 27, we decided to conduct the experiment on graduate students in various institutions. We used the blocking method with the gender of our participants
so we also had to keep in mind the number of participants from each gender.
* Tools: RStudio (data.table, tidyverse, modelsummary)

# [Project 4: Car Listing Price Predictions on eBay](https://github.com/cchang72/BA_810/blob/main/BA810_Team6_Cars_Listing_Predictions.pdf) 
* Background/Objective: The project goal is to predict listing price of used cars on eBay based on several predictors such as vehicle type, gearbox, fuel type, and kilometers on car. Doing so allows us to provide insight/guidance for future buyers and sellers on the prices they should list or bid on eBay for used cars. 
* Tools: RStudio (data.table, ggplot2, glmnet, randomForest)

# [Project 5: Drowsiness Detection](https://github.com/cchang72/BA865_Project/blob/main/BA_865_Final_Project_v2.ipynb)
* Background/Objective: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are approximately 100,000 car crashes, 800 fatalities, and 50,000 injuries every year related to drowsy-driving in the US (nsc, n.d.). To help combat this issue, our team decided to come up with image classification algorithms trained on 4000 images with two classes, open and closed, to detect whether a person's eyes are open or not. We hope this would be the first step to more improved algorithms to come in reducing the number of drowsy-driving fatalities not only in the US but worldwide as well.
* Tools: Python (Tensorflow/Keras)/Google Colaboratory Notebook

# [Project 6: Financial and Accounting Analytics of Stock Returns (Early 2022 Market Shock)](https://github.com/cchang72/BA870_Project/blob/main/Project%20-%20Chris%20Chang.ipynb)
* Background/Objective: It is apparent that the stock market shock in early 2022 was mainly caused by the COVID pandemic. However, what exactly were the factors that influenced the stock returns during the early market shock in 2022? In this project, I've analyzed stock returns using three indicators: Financial ratios, Fama-French risk factors, and Industry indicators to explain the impact of each indicator on stock returns and gave suggestions on what indicators to focus on when investing in a stock. 
* Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statmodels)/Google Colaboratory Notebook

# [Project 7: Diabetes Detection](https://github.com/cchang72/BA890_Project/blob/main/BA890_Diabetes_Detection_(Chris_Chang).ipynb)
* Background: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) approximates that 34.2 million Americans have diabetes and 88 million have prediabetes. Furthermore, Diabetes creates a massive burden on the overall economy, with diabetes-related costs of approximately 327 billion dollars. Diabetes is characterized by the lack of ability to regulate blood glucose levels. Specifically, when food is broken down into sugars and released into the bloodstream, the pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that turns the sugars into energy. Diabetes causes the body to not produce enough insulin levels or not able to utilize insulin effectively. This can lead to diseases related to the heart, vision, and kidney.
* Objective: In this project, I aim to detect risk factors that are most highly correlated with diabetes as well as use ML models to predict whether an individual has diabetes through these risk factors.
* Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), Google Colaboratory Notebook
