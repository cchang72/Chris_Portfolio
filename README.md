# Project 1: Analyzing Air Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic
* Collaborated with five teammates from three different countries and gathered real-time Air Quality data within the OpenAQ database to explore the changes in air quality (AQI and pollutant type levels) between 2019 and 2020 in cities and countries where COVID-19 was most prevalent.
* Utilized SQL and Tableau to analyze and visualize pollutant and presented key findings and data visualizations through PowerPoint and Tableau Public to stakeholders, receiving a near-perfect score for the project overall.
