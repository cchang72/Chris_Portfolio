# [Project 1: Analyzing Air Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://github.com/arp-jain/BA775-team2-b2)
* Collaborated with five teammates from three different countries and gathered real-time Air Quality data within the OpenAQ database to explore the changes in air quality (AQI and pollutant type levels) between 2019 and 2020 in cities and countries where COVID-19 was most prevalent.
* Utilized SQL and Tableau to analyze and visualize pollutant and presented key findings and data visualizations through PowerPoint and Tableau Public to stakeholders, receiving a near-perfect score for the project overall.

* Background: A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who received training. "Company" wants to analyze the factors affecting candiates' decision on staying or looking for a new job after training.
* Objective: The project goal is to predict whether a data scientist candidate will look for a new employment or wants to work for the company after training, which helps optimize HR costs and increase efficiencies. By using both descriptive and predictive analysis on a companyâ€™s HR dataset, we seek to interpret affecting factors on employee decisions.

* Background and Objective: The project goal is to predict listing price of used cars on eBay based on several predictors such as vehicle type, gearbox, fuel type, and kilometers on car. Doing so allows us to provide insight/guidance for future buyers and sellers on the prices they should list or bid on eBay for used cars.
